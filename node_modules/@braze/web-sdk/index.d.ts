  /**
   * When a user first uses Braze on a device they are considered "anonymous". Use this method to identify a user
   *    with a unique ID, which enables the following:
   *
   *    - If the same user is identified on another device, their user profile, usage history and event history will
   *        be shared across devices.
   *    - If your app is used on the same browser by multiple people, you can assign each of them a unique identifier
   *        to track them separately. Only the most recent user on a particular browser will receive push
   *        notifications and in-app messages.
   *
   * When you request a user switch (which is any call to changeUser where the new user ID is not the same as the
   *    existing user ID), the current session for the previous user (anonymous or not) is automatically ended and
   *    a new session is started. Similarly, following a call to changeUser, any events which fire are guaranteed to
   *    be for the new user -- if an in-flight server request completes for the old user after the user switch no
   *    events will fire, so you do not need to worry about filtering out events from Braze for old users.
   *
   * Additionally, if you identify a user which has never been identified on another device, the entire history of
   *    that user as an "anonymous" user on this device will be preserved and associated with the newly identified
   *    user. However, if you identify a user which *has* been identified in another app, any history which was
   *    already flushed to the server for the anonymous user on this device will become orphaned and will not be
   *    associated with any future users. These orphaned users are not considered in your user counts and will not
   *    be messaged.
   *
   * Note: Once you identify a user, you cannot revert to the "anonymous" user. The transition from anonymous to
   *    identified tracking is only allowed once because the initial anonymous user receives special treatment to
   *    allow for preservation of their history. As a result, we recommend against changing the user ID just because
   *    your app has entered a "logged out" state because it makes you unable to target the previously logged out user
   *    with re-engagement campaigns. If you anticipate multiple users on the same device, but only want to target one
   *    of them when your app is in a logged out state, we recommend separately keeping track of the user ID you want
   *    to target while logged out and switching back to that user ID as part of your app's logout process.
